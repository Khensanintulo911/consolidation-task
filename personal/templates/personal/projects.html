    <p>What Inspires Me & The Projects I Create</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What Inspires Me</h2>
        <p>My journey is shaped by where I come from and what I believe in. I grew up in a South African township, where challenges exist side by side with community strength, creativity, and resilience. That environment taught me how to adapt, how to build with limited tools, and how to think practically.</p>
        <p><strong>Politics and social change</strong> have always inspired me — the power of ordinary people shaping their future motivates me to create tools that solve everyday problems. <strong>Religion</strong> grounds me; it teaches me humility, purpose, and service — values I carry into my work. My inspiration doesn’t just come from code — it comes from lived experience, from watching people navigate life, hustle, and still dream.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Task Management System</strong><br>
                A full-featured app designed to help users organize tasks, assign deadlines, and track progress. Inspired by the need for structure in fast-paced, often chaotic environments. (Built with Django & SQLite)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Student Support App (Upcoming)</strong><br>
                A concept aimed at helping financially and emotionally struggling students keep track of university admin, motivational resources, and budgeting tools. Draws from my own university experience and the importance of holistic support.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Minimalist Journal</strong><br>
                A lightweight, distraction-free journal app for writing thoughts, gratitude, or daily prayers. Clean design, offline-first, focused on mindfulness and mental clarity.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>My Philosophy as a Creator</h2>
        <p>I don’t just build apps — I build tools for people like me: those who need structure in uncertainty, who hustle hard, who dream of better. Every line of code is shaped by who I am, where I’m from, and where I believe I’m going. I believe tech should be useful, accessible, and built with compassion.</p>
